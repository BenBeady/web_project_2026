    <h2>What this page is</h2>
    <p>This page is a simple overview of projects and practice work. I am keeping it organized and focused, because the goal is to show what I have built and what I learned from it, not to overwhelm the page with random details.</p>
    <p>Right now the biggest priority is writing clear descriptions and using semantic structure correctly. Later, once styling is allowed, I will make it look cleaner. For now, the structure has to carry the page.</p>
    <p>I also want each project description to answer the same basic questions. What was the goal, what did I build, and what did I learn. That makes it easier for someone reading to understand the point quickly.</p>

      <h3>Semantic HTML three page site</h3>
      <p>This project is the website you are currently on. The goal is to build three pages with real content using semantic HTML elements and a clear heading outline. I am intentionally not using CSS yet so I can focus on structure and meaning first.</p>
      <p>The biggest improvement I have made through this project is learning to think about content as part of the design. If the content is weak or confusing, the site fails even if it looks nice.</p>

      <h3>Basic PHP form handling practice</h3>
      <p>I have also been building simple PHP scripts that receive user input, validate it, and print results. This kind of work connects to backend fundamentals because it forces you to be careful with user data and conditions.</p>
      <p>The reason I like this type of practice is because it is close to real applications. Almost every real system involves taking in input, checking if it is valid, and responding in a predictable way.</p>

      <h3>What I am adding next</h3>
      <p>As I complete more assignments, I plan to add more entries here and make each one more specific. I want this page to turn into a simple portfolio style list where each project has a clear description and a link to the code.</p>
      <p>If I add a table later, it will only be for data that actually belongs in a table, like a structured comparison or a schedule. I do not want to use tables for layout.</p>
