    <h2>What this page is</h2>
    <p>This page is a simple overview of projects and practice work. I am keeping it organized and focused, because the goal is to show what I have built and what I learned from it, not to overwhelm the page with random details.</p>
    <p class="highlight">Right now I am practicing controlled CSS changes, so the site stays readable while I learn how selectors target semantic structure.</p>
    <p>For now, the structure has to carry the page. Later, once we cover spacing, layout, and typography, I will refine how it looks without losing the meaning.</p>

      <h3>Semantic HTML three page site</h3>
      <p>This project is the website you are currently on. The goal is to build three pages with real content using semantic HTML elements and a clear heading outline. I am intentionally keeping styling light so the structure stays the focus.</p>
      <p>The biggest improvement I have made through this project is learning to think about content as part of the design. If the content is weak or confusing, the site fails even if it looks nice.</p>

      <h3>Basic PHP practice</h3>
      <p>I have also been building simple PHP scripts that receive user input, validate it, and print results. This kind of work connects to backend fundamentals because it forces you to be careful with user data and conditions.</p>
      <p>I like this practice because it is close to how real apps work. A lot of software is just input, validation, and predictable output.</p>

      <h3>What I am adding next</h3>
      <p>As I complete more assignments, I plan to add more entries here and link directly to the code. I want this page to be easy to skim and easy to understand.</p>
      <p>If I add a table later, it will only be for real tabular data like comparisons or summaries. I do not want to use tables as a layout shortcut.</p>
