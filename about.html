    <h2>Who I am</h2>
    <p>My name is Ben Beady and I built this site as part of my coursework, but I am treating it like the beginning of a real portfolio. I want it to feel clear and organized, not like a bunch of random practice files thrown together.</p>
    <p>I like building things that actually do something useful. I am most interested in full stack work, especially the backend side where systems connect, data moves around, and one small bug can break everything. I like figuring out how to make things reliable.</p>
    <p>Even when I am working on simple assignments like this, I try to think about the user. If someone lands on this page, I want them to understand what they are looking at and where to click next without having to guess.</p>

    <h2>How I think about web development</h2>

      <h3>Structure first</h3>
      <p>I used to rush toward adding features or making something look cool. This project is forcing me to slow down and focus on structure and meaning. If the HTML is messy or unclear, styling later will not fix it.</p>
      <p>That is why I am using semantic elements like header, nav, main, section, article, and footer. I want the page to make sense even without any CSS. It also helps me write content that matches the purpose of each page.</p>

      <h3>Details matter</h3>
      <p>From past experience, I learned that small details are what separate a page that feels smooth from a page that feels confusing. Headings, labels, and logical ordering are the difference between a user trusting a site and leaving it instantly.</p>
      <p>I am working on making my writing more specific instead of filler. If I say I know something, I want to back it up with what I actually did, what I learned, and what I can improve next.</p>

    <h2>What I want to improve</h2>
    <p>I want to get better at explaining my work. I can build things, but being able to communicate clearly is just as important, especially if I am showing projects to employers or teammates.</p>
    <p>I also want to keep improving my technical foundation. For me that means getting stronger with backend logic, APIs, data flow, and building systems that behave correctly when real people use them.</p>
