    <h2>What this site is for</h2>
    <p>This website is a course project focused on writing real content and organizing it using semantic HTML5. The point is to build pages that make sense even without styling, so the structure and meaning come first.</p>
    <p>I am using headings to create a clear outline on each page. If someone skimmed only the headings, they should still understand what the page is about and where to find information.</p>
    <p>Instead of filling the page with extra features, I am focusing on basic web fundamentals that support usability. This includes readable paragraph content, consistent navigation, and predictable page organization.</p>

    <h2>My background with HTML</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>Hands on experience</h3>
      <p>I have used HTML in real work settings, mainly to build and edit web forms and structured content for users. That experience taught me that small details matter, like clear labels, good ordering, and content that matches what the user expects.</p>

      <h3>What I am practicing in this project</h3>
      <p>In this project I am practicing semantic elements such as header, nav, main, section, article, and footer. I want the page to communicate meaning through structure instead of relying on layout tricks.</p>

    <h2>Resources I actually use</h2>
    <p>When I learn or troubleshoot HTML, I rely on documentation and examples that explain not only how something works, but why it works. These are two resources I return to often.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN Web Docs</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3Schools</a></li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>Optional table of experience</h2>
    <p>This table summarizes a few areas where I have practical experience. It is included because it represents structured information that is easier to scan as a table than as a paragraph.</p>

    <table>
      <caption>Experience Summary</caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Skill</th>
          <th scope="col">Example Experience</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>HTML Forms</td>
          <td>Built and edited form pages with input fields, labels, and validation expectations.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Semantic Structure</td>
          <td>Organized content using headings and meaningful elements instead of generic containers.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
